# expo_test_mock_api
Used to mock an API for use on a frontend application.

The mock api can be viewed using [my-json-server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/bytelion/expo_test_mock_api/) to provide the mock of the api.

The following items are included in this repo to mock API calls to a backend service, these calls are not persisted but calls for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE can be used to mock functionality.
